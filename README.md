# MAS_Project_2019

In this repository we provide:
* The code for the ad-hoc converter written in JAVA to convert the FAP instances into XCSP ones.
* The converted instances in the directory "converted instances".
* A spread sheet for all the statistics gathered from the tests using FRODO.
* In the directory "simple_instance" the instance explained in the report as designed in FAP website (dom,var,ctr) and the converted one in xml using the converter plus the log of dpop algorithm when run over this instances using FRODO.
* And last the report MASProject.pdf contains the description and modeling of FAP in DCOP and also the results of the tests and the comments and the comparisons between the algorithms provided.

For lunching the converter you have to run the Main.java in /src where it accepts two arguments:
* 1st: The full path directory of the FAP instances.
* 2nd: The output directory where you would like to write the instances file.

**NOTE**

The program will convert all the available instances in the directory you specify
